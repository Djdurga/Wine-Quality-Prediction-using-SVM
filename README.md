# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using SVM

This notebook demonstrates the use of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify wine quality based on physicochemical features using the `WineQT.csv` dataset.

---

## 📌 Overview

We aim to predict the **quality of wine** (likely framed as a classification problem) using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The workflow includes:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model training using SVM
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualization using seaborn/matplotlib

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (for SVM and evaluation)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `WineQT.csv`, which contains various chemical properties of red wine and a quality score.

Example features:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- pH
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)
